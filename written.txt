Benchmark results for the GRR scheduler are given below:

GeekBench 

|FG Cores|BG Cores|Single Core score|Multi Core score|
|   1    |    3   |        614      |       613      |
|   2    |    2   |        618      |      1143      |
|   3    |    1   |        618      |      1418      |

Quadrant

|FG Cores|BG Cores|    CPU score    |   Total score  |
|   1    |    3   |       3399      |      2876      |
|   2    |    2   |       6968      |      3811      |
|   3    |    1   |       9191      |      4623      |

It is evident that with an increase in the number of cores
assigned to foreground tasks, the performance significantly
increases. In fact, the performance improvement is almost linear
with the number of foreground cores.

For reference, the default linux scheduler gives scores of 610/1709
for single and multiple cores on GeekBench. In addition, the RR
scheduler is quite similar to the default linux scheduler based
on GeekBench scores.

The degraded performance of GRR can be attributed to the longer
critical sections, particularly when moving tasks around 
depending on their groups and the like. 

In addition, there is also a qualitative difference in the performance
of the device. The boot time lag is quite evident and opening up 
applications is rather jittery. This observation is in sync with the
quantitative results that were obtained by running the benchmark 
applications.
